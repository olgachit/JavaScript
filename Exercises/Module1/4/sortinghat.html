<h1>In the Harry Potter children's books, the sorting hat assigns a new student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to one of the four classes, which are Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw. Write an electronic sorting hat that asks for a student's name and draws a room for him. If you enter Anna as the name, for example, the program prints to the HTML document "Anna, you are Ravenclaw." (3p)<br>

Use math.random() to draw a value (1, 2, 3 or 4)<br>
Once the number is drawn, you need to use a multiple choice structure (if, else if, ..., else or switch).</h1>
