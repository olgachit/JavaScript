<h1>Write a program that asks the user for an integer and tells if the number is a prime number. (2p)<br>

Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and itself.<br>
For example, number 13 is a prime number as it can only be divided by 1 or 13 so that the result is an integer.<br>
On the other hand, number 21 for example is not a prime number as it can be also be divided by numbers 3 and 7.<br>
Print the result on the HTML document.</h1>
<script>
    function isPrime(num) {
    if (num <= 1) {
        return false;
    }
    for (let i = 2; i * i <= num; i++) {
        if (num % i === 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

const number = parseInt(prompt("Enter an integer:"));

if (isPrime(number)) {
    document.body.innerHTML += `<p>${number} is a prime number.</p>`;
} else {
    document.body.innerHTML += `<p>${number} is not a prime number.</p>`;
